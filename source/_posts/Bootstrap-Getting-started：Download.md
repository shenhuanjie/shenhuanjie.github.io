Download Bootstrap to get the compiled CSS and JavaScript, source code, or include it with your favorite package managers like npm, RubyGems, and more.

## Compiled CSS and JS

Download ready-to-use compiled code for Bootstrap v5.3.2 to easily drop into your project, which includes:

* Compiled and minified CSS bundles
* Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins

This doesn’t include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies like Popper.

## Source files

Compile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files. This option requires some additional tooling:

* Sass compiler for compiling Sass source files into CSS files 
* Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixing

Should you require our full set of build tools, they are included for developing Bootstrap and its docs, but they’re likely unsuitable for your own purposes.
